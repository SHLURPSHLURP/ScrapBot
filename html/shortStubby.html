                    <p>Before humanity vanished, Short Stubby was a warehouse assistant bot designed for heavy lifting in small spaces. It was built with reinforced plating, short but powerful limbs, and a simple AI meant for taking orders and carrying out basic tasks.
                        When the catastrophe struck, Short Stubby was left abandoned, slowly deteriorating in the rubble. Its memory banks are mostly corrupted, leaving only fragments of its pastâ€”flashes of carrying crates, following commands, and an ingrained instinct to be helpful.</p>

                        <li>>Conflict Avoidance: With Short Stubby's protectiveness, ScrapBot won't have to fight. However, there is a 50% chance ScrapBot will lose and ScrapBot will have to fight.</li>
                        <li>>Strength: Short Stubby is able to carry back an extra scrap every adventure.</li>
